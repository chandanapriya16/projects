# Image-Caption-Generator

The objective of our project is to learn the concepts of a CNN and LSTM model and build a working model of Image caption generator by implementing CNN with LSTM.
CNN is used for extracting features from the image. We will use the pre-trained model Xception.
LSTM will use the information from CNN to help generate a description of the image.
